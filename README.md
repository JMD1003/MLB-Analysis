# MLB-Analysis

This was originally a school assignment; however, baseball has always been something I have been interested in and have played for years at a very high level (AAA). Due to those reasons, I decided to expand upon it and perform exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, regression modelling, and model validation. There are still some remnants from my original assignment, including things like the objectives section and parts of the correlation analysis.
